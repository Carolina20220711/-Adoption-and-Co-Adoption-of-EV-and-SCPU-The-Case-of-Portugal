 Adoption and Co-Adoption of Electric Vehicles and Self-Consumption Production Units: The Case of Portugal

## Abstract:
The transition toward clean energy systems has accelerated in response to climate change, with electric mobility and self-consumption production units, such as rooftop solar, playing key roles. While existing research has identified various factors influencing technology adoption, there remains a critical knowledge gap regarding the adoption patterns of these technologies across Portuguese districts. This study addresses this gap using descriptive analysis by examining: (1) temporal adoption patterns of both technologies; (2) spatial disparities in adoption across districts; (3) evidence of co-adoption; and (4) districts requiring targeted policy interventions. Drawing on multiple data sources, including vehicle sales, self-consumption production installations, demographic data, and using a descriptive analysis, this study reveals distinct but complementary adoption patterns. Battery electric vehicles have overtaken plug-in hybrid electric vehicles post-2020, while self-consumption production units’ installations peaked in the second semester of 2023, followed by a market stabilization. Some of the key findings suggest that coastal and urban districts show higher electric mobility adoption, while per capita self-consumption production units’ adoption is stronger in districts adjacent to Lisbon and Porto (the biggest urban centers). Braga and Leiria emerge as key co-adopters, while border regions like Beja and Portalegre consistently underperform. These findings provide valuable insights for developing geographically tailored policies to enhance technology adoption, reduce regional disparities, and support the achievement of European Union greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.

## Data Sources:
Vehicle sales data records, including vehicle classification categories (e.g., light-duty vehicles, motorcycles), and the Energy of the vehicle (e.g., BEV, Diesel/PHEV, Gasoline) were obtained from the Portuguese Automobile Association (ACAP). This dataset is not publicly available and was provided directly by ACAP. Technical data related to SCPUs was collected from E-redes, including the number of active installations and the number of new installation units (E-Redes, 2025a; E-Redes, 2025b). To contextualize technology adoption within demographic frameworks, population statistics were retrieved from the National Institute of Statistics (INE) (Instituto Nacional de Estatística, 2025). Additionally, data on Portugal’s administrative divisions, specifically municipalities and districts, were extracted from Direção-Geral do Território (DGT) (Direção Geral do Território, 2025).
